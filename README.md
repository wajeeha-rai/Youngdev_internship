# YoungDev Internship – Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a series of Machine Learning tasks and deployment exercises completed during my internship at **YoungDev**. Each task is designed to build foundational and intermediate skills in data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and deployment.

## 📌 Project Highlights

### ✅ Basic Tasks
- **Simple Linear Regression**
  - Fit and visualize a linear model using scikit-learn and matplotlib.
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
  - Trained on the Iris dataset and evaluated using accuracy and a confusion matrix.
- **Scatter Plot Visualization**
  - Visualized relationships between features using matplotlib and seaborn.

### ✅ Intermediate Tasks
- **Model Evaluation with Cross-Validation**
  - Used k-fold cross-validation to assess accuracy and F1-score across folds.
- **Data Preprocessing**
  - Handled missing values, normalized features, encoded categorical variables, and split data.
- **Classification Report**
  - Generated a detailed report including precision, recall, and F1-score using scikit-learn.

### ✅ Advanced Tasks
- **Neural Network for Classification**
  - Built and trained a simple neural network using TensorFlow to classify data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**
  - Applied GridSearchCV to optimize model parameters for better performance.
- **Model Deployment (Flask + GCP)**
  - Deployed a trained model using Flask API and hosted it on Google Cloud App Engine.

## 🚀 How to Run the Deployment
1. Make sure `Flask`, `scikit-learn`, `joblib`, and other dependencies are installed (see `requirements.txt`).
2. To run locally:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. For GCP Deployment:
   - Upload your trained model to the working directory.
   - Deploy with:
     ```bash
     gcloud app deploy
     ```
